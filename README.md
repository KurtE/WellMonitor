Warning:
========

This project is setup to hold my Well monitoring Arduino Sketch.  The sketch is not done or functional yet.

Hardware
========

This project is setup to run on a Teensy 3.6 (maybe 3.5 as well) and is using one of my own boards.  I am 
not sure yet if I pushed up my board design yet... The board is designed to be the same size of the PJRC ILI9341 touch screen and has
a connector to plug on of these into. 

The board is setup with an RFM95 LoRa chip, plus has a Neopixel, plus a small speaker and Sound Amp chip that connects up to a DAC...

The board is setup to handle 4 of the Sparkfun Current Sensors. 

Software
========

Again WIP - Probably nothing very useful to anyone yet...
